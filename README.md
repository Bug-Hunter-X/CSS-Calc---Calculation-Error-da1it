This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `calc()` function in CSS. The `bug.css` file shows the incorrect implementation, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version. The issue stems from an invalid calculation within `calc()`, which leads to unexpected layout or styling problems.  The solution involves carefully reviewing the syntax and units used in the calculation to ensure it's valid CSS.
